My strategy for this project, was to first get familiar with the API.
I then started by planning on how the flow of the program would go.
I decided that Emit() would return the value of the operation generated,
that way the caller could potentially use the results of that instruction.

I started by implementing Emit() for the declarations. I then move 
on to generating code for the statements and finally I generated 
code for all the expressions possible that could be parsed.

This program takes a .glsl source file that contains a program compiles it
and creates a new file .bc.


To use compile the source file:
	./glc < foo.glsl > foo.bc


To execute the program:
	./gli foo.bc
